# The A-maze-ing-Race

The goal of the project is to design and program a robot capable of navigating through a maze in the shortest time possible while completing various waypoint challenges. These challenges involve detecting coloured waypoints and executing the correct turning maneuvers based on the decoded colour signals. The robot integrates multiple sensors, including an ultrasonic sensor, an infrared (IR) sensor, a line sensor, and a colour-sensing module. This enables the bot to detect maze walls, align itself, and interpret colour-based commands to perform accurate turns. 
The project combines both hardware design and software programming aspects which allowed our team to gain practical experience in circuit design, calibration, debugging and algorithm design.
